# OS dependent emoji display

🐊 An emoji looks totally different for you than to me if we are looking it from different platforms. Everyone has a preffered set of emojis and it can be disheartening to see that the content we've carefully created has a totally different meaning on another platform, another OS. Let's see what we can do about this phenomenon.

## Emojipedia

[Emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org/) is the best source for emojis.
In case of my favourite one, the `:crocodile:` there is a warning on the site says:

```
🚩 Appearance differs greatly cross-platform. Use with caution.
```

...and they seems they are not joking!
