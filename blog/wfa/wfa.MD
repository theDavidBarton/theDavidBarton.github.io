        <p>An immersive workspace is no longer limited to a desk in our Towers; <strong>the 9-to-5 workday is dead</strong>; and the employee experience is about more than ping-pong tables and snacks.</p>

Work from home indefinitely. Shouldn't this option exist since at least a decade when high-bandwidth connection has become worldwide? However in the developing countries the broadband speed still can be [between 4 to 50 Mbps](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/internet-speeds-by-country) (while in the US the avarage is 161.14 Mbps, source: Speedtest Global Index)

The sole good side of COVID-19 of the acceptance of home office globally. The latest [announcment from Spotify](https://hrblog.spotify.com/2021/02/12/introducing-working-from-anywhere/) brings something brand new to the remote work topic. Spotify will "introduce more flexibility when it comes to **what country and city each employee works from** (with some limitations to address time zone difficulties [...])". This can lead to the end of discrimination based on location of the employees. Can you imagine how it can extend the current boundries of workplaces? Someone from Africa can work for a Northern European company (if the high speed internet is/will be availble). Another example: someone who lives on the [lagging regions](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/rethinking-lagging-regions) could work for a company based in the capital. Is it realistic? It is, and now it seems also feasible.
Here is a list of the companies who has already announced _Work from Anywhere (WFA)_ or hybrid conditions for their employees.
