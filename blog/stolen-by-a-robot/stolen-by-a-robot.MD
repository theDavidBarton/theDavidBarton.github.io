# Stolen by a robot (Strange days indeed)

Lately, I've found a strange phenomenon, that one of my [Guitar Pro](https://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php) tabs (tabbed in August 2005) was exported as a standalone song by someone and was published on Spotify. [Strange days indeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuuhsqA95iA), as John Lennon would say.

I just realized that we could have released our music already 15 years ago. :D

The artist publishes 8-bit MIDI-based sound exports as covers of famous artists (possibly using Guitar Pro 5(?) sound engine to make their sound more realistic):

One of the featured "songs" **_There's No Way Out Of Here_ by Monster Magnet** was tabbed by myself 15 years ago, it is the very same Guitar Pro tab :D https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/monster-magnet/theres-no-way-out-of-here-guitar-pro-1142980 The uploader is another rascal, if you are able to download the file, you will find my name in the file info :D. Strange thing, that I was unable to find my upload back from 2005, it makes me skeptical about the _"if you post something online then it's out there forever"_ rule. Which I actually don't mind, the censored parts are by purpose on the screenshot :) Come on, I was about 15-16 that time.

## How?

Based on the work of the artist it seems a manual job of collecting Guitar Pro tabs then slightly editing them and publishing on online stores. I am pretty sure it is not done by a robot at the moment (even if the album covers with the knight head would [suggest it](https://pbfcomics.com/comics/gigaknight/)).

However: such job could be automated:

1. a web crawler (using e.g. [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)) would collect the tabs,
2. then a UI automation tool would export the songs to wave format and
3. finally, the upload of the albums can be solved with browser automation again.

Of course, its result wouldn't be quality music, but maybe not worse than the artist's current work.

At least I can say: I have at least one song on Spotify^^.
