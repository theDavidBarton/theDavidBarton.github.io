<item><title>Anonymous IIFE-s and semicolons</title><link>https://theDavidBarton.github.io/anonymous-IIFE-fn</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid>https://theDavidBarton.github.io/anonymous-IIFE-fn</guid><description>IIFE is an elegant way to execute what should be executed anyway in our JavaScript code. If it is also an anonymous function then it is almost sure that the returned value is not used later on. When it comes to semicolon-less JavaScript styles it gets tricky (and ugly).
